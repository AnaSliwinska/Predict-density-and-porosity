## Introduction

The main goal of this project was to predict density and porosity. To predict density and porosity I used sonic/acoustic dataset like velocity of longitudinal wave and velocity of transverse wave and Poisson,s ratio. In this case I used XGBoost Algorithm to predict petrophysical parameters. Firstly, the model predicted density data, next the model predicted porosity with using sonic dataset and density.The predict data was used in geoscience projects.
